### Structure

`index.html` and `main.js` are files loaded into browser
json-server is a program downloaded with npm which acts as
a server and using db.json file as a mock database. You can
use this template to finish the frontend part of the
assignment, and when done replace json-server with your
real working backend server when we have learned how to do
so. :-)

### How to run

- $ git clone <repo-url>
- $ cd <repo>
- $ npm install
- $ npx json-server db.json (donÂ´t close the terminal!)
- open index.html in browser
- Done!
